# Splunk / ADDC Lab

## Objective

The Splunk / ADDC project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Active Directory Domain Services (ADDC) – Server that runs Microsoft Active Directory and manages authentication, authorization, and directory services in a Windows domain.

- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) – Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in used for managing Active Directory (AD) objects.

- Hydra – Fast and powerful password-cracking tool used for brute-force attacks against various network protocols and authentication services.

- RDP – Protocol that allows users to remotely access and control another computer over a network.

- Splunk – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.

- Splunk Universal Forwarder – A lightweight agent that collects and forwards log data from various sources to a Splunk indexer for analysis.

- Sysmon – Windows system service and driver that logs detailed system activity, including process creation, network connections, and file modifications.

- VirtualBox – Open-source virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single machine.
